# AIM-22
                                                                       PROJECT TOPIC 
Designing a software to resolve a wide variety of business-related problems, forms and formats  geological, topography, geo-mechanical, engineering, mineralogy, and well logging data to augment each phase of mining, using AI.
ABSTRACT:
Our product will include machine learning, optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities which will be customizable, unified and a modular platform which will allow clients to build their own experiences around it to suit their needs. The main problems that can be solved are:
•	It can forecast revenues, identify requirement of potential products, understand customer behavior, provide deep understanding of contracts and identify lack of compliance or fraud.
•	It can improve order to cash process by creating a real-time risk profile to customize the collection strategy, expedite resolution of disputes, predict anomalies, prevent disputes, and enable better visibility and forecasting of cash flow to reduce days sales outstanding.
•	It can predict variability in manufacturing and material cost, while also reducing product development cycle times.
•	It can create knowledge models of multiple, complex labor contracts with an on-demand, self-service conversational interface to operationalize the knowledge.
•	It can create a customer genome based on internal and external data sources to help develop targeted messaging, accurately identify upselling and cross-selling opportunities, offer personalized solutions, and improve customer satisfaction.
•	It accelerates prospecting, discovery and exploration by predicting target zones and using soil samples from a few test holes to classify the total surface area / rock face / subsurface materials. AI algorithms streamline ore fragmentation assessment, pre- and post-blast surveys and site inspections in underground and open pit mines using satellite imagery, aerial photographs and 3D maps.
•	AI programs combine core drill data, sample analysis results and survey reports to recommend techniques for maximizing ore deposits. Moreover, it guides geologists and engineers in extraction planning and optimization. Advanced analysis of composite samples enables quantification of ore reserves as well as impurities in the output. The data helps streamline processing and sorting procedures to conserve energy and minimize truck rolls.
•	Multivariable modeling can be used to predict and address constraints in the development and construction phases. The AI platform solutions accelerate returns on newly discovered ores by providing insights to extract and process minerals and metals efficiently and safely. It empowers digital mines built with sensor network technologies to capitalize on IoT data for real-time surveillance and operations management.
•	It will combine robotic automation and industrial IoT to manage autonomous drilling systems and hauling fleets. It will help mining enterprises, use fleet motion metrics to minimize asset idle time and prevent equipment collision. Significantly, its machine learning algorithms will be trained to extract contextual data from complex documents, identify risks, and respond to user queries.
